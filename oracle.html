                <h1>Data Science Internship at Oracle</h1>
                <p>I spent Summer 2023 in Seattle, WA, as a Data Science Intern at Oracle on their Design team.
                    My project focused on analyzing user click log data to detect robotic automation processes (RPAs).

                <h2>My Project</h2>
                <p>I was fortunate to work on a fascinating project that perfectly aligned with my
                    passion for using data science to understand real human experiences. Not only that,
                    but my project will continue beyond my internship and the team will incorporate my
                    contributions into their ongoing work. I was tasked with analyzing mass amounts of
                    user-generated click log telemetry data to detect RPAs interacting with Oracle enterprise
                    software, distinguish RPA behavior from human behavior, and try to understand why customers
                    may be using RPAs.</p>
                <p>RPAs are commonly known as bots. The word "bot" has a negative connotation, but not all bots are malicious.
                    Bots are simply an automated online process, often meant to automate a tedious task that a human would otherwise have to do.
                    In fact, around 1/3 of all Internet traffic is bots.
                </p>
                <h2>My Contribution</h2>
                <p>I discovered a type of robotic automated behavior and built a pipeline in Python to clean the data, engineer features,
                    find common click patterns within sessions, visualize them, and identify this type of RPA behavior.
                </p>
                <p>My project is relevant to the Design team becauase if users are frequently automating tasks, it may be an opportunity
                    for the designers to redesign those interfaces to make those tasks easier or automated.</p>

                <h2>The Process</h2>
                <p>The technologies I used for this project are Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I began by researching the context of the problem: robotic automation processes and how their
                    online behavior differs from humans.</li>
                    <li>I then cleaned the dataset.</li>
                    <li>Then I exploreed the dataset, looking at the distribution of certain features of the dataset
                        and found many outliers.</li>
                    <li>I chose some indicators of RPA behavior: rapid clicking, abnormally long session, and abnormally large
                        number of windows or browser tabs.</li>
                    <li>I chose one user session to investigate further which was a far outlier in all three of these features.
                        My mentors had me focus on one session first in order to get a very low-level understanding and then
                        generalize my findings to all sessions.</li>
                    
                </ul>

                <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                <p>I have honed my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis,
                    data visualization, and UX research. But beyond these technical skills,
                    I’ve gained a skill that’s just as vital: the ability to explain complex technical
                    concepts to a non-technical audience, a must for any data scientist. Additionally,
                    by working with users’ click data and actively thinking about their experience,
                    I learned to look beyond the numbers to understand the experience of the human behind
                    them — the “story” behind the data. Because this was a research project,
                    I also learned to be curious and skeptical. Before I could convince anyone else that I
                    had found bots, I wanted to convince myself entirely.
                    I am very grateful for the interdisciplinary experience
                    I had in my role in the intersection of data science and design.</p>
