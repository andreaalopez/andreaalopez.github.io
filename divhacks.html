                <h1>DivHacks 2022</h1>
                <p>On September 23-24 of 2022, I participated in Columbia's annual hackathon, DivHacks. It was a pivotal moment for me.</p>
                <p>My team created a website for disaster relief in Puerto Rico, a cause near to my heart.
                    We won the hackathon in two categories: Best Beginner and Best Use of Velo by Wix!

                <h2>Challenges I Faced</h2>
                <p>DivHacks 2022 was my very first hackathon. I was new to web development and initially felt
                    intimidated by the large task at hand. I felt like I was the only person in the room who had
                    no idea what they were doing. But I didn’t quit — and I’m so glad I didn’t, because the result
                    was incredible self-growth for me. I got to create a website aimed at an issue close to my heart,
                    learn HTML and CSS, and kickstart my web dev journey. And my team won in two categories!
                </p>
                <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                <p>
                    I am so proud of myself for stepping outside of my comfort zone and making the most out of a new experience.
                    It helped me realize how much potential technology has for human impact, and it taught me to seize
                    learning opportunities no matter how daunting they may seem. It was truly a pivotal moment in my college
                    experience that boosted my confidence and bravery.

                <h2>Connect Puerto Rico</h2>
                <div class="dh-pic">
                    <img src="images/connect-pr.png" alt="Connect Puerto Rico website" id="dh-connect-pr">
                </div>
                <p>Connect Puerto Rico is a website meant to provide disaster relief aid to Puerto Rican citizens
                    during natural disasters such as Hurricane Fiona.
                </p>
                <p>My idea was inspired by my family's story with Hurricane Fiona. My parents, brother and I live in New Jersey,
                    but more of our family lives in Puerto Rico and were directly affected by the hurricane. Due to the destruction,
                    my family in Puerto Rico had no Internet access and therefore couldn't reach us to let us know they were okay.
                    In response, we scoured the Internet (Google, Facebook, Instagram) looking for photos and posts that anyone was able to upload.
                    Different parts of the island were affected differently, so we hoped that we could find pictures of or updates about Moca
                    to infer my family in Moca's situation, photos of Guaynabo for my family in Guaynabo, etc.
                </p>
                <p>What if there had been one place for all of these posts? A place where people (those with any Internet access) could upload
                    pictures of different parts of the island, perhaps with geo-tags. My family and I could have searched this website for Moca
                    and Guaynabo and quickly seen what the situation in each city was. This is the problem Connect Puerto Rico hoped to solve,
                    along with providing other resources such as a donation system and volunteer system.
